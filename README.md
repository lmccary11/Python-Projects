# Python-Projects

Below are some the projects I had the pleasure of completing during my PYTHON course. 
This collection includes the implementation of sqlite3, tkinter, PyCharm, Django, anf the Windows OS.

PHONEBOOK

This project utilizes a database to save and manage a collection of contacts. Using tkinter, the project allows the user to add, update and delete contact information through a basic entry window.

FILE TRANSFER

This project allows for users to move files between folders based on preset parameters. The application uses tkinter as the User Interface and checks for files recently added or modified in the last 24 hours in the folder of the user's choosing. The user also determines the end destination of files through the interface.

CHECKBOOK

This project uses DJjango and PyCharm to create a checkbook web application. Through the site the user can create new accounts, get the balance of the accounts, record transactions on a fluid and pleasing website.
Also heavily utilized during this project was the command prompt and the use of virtual environments.
